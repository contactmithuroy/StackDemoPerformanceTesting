# StackDemoPerformanceTesting 

## Overview
This project evaluates the performance of the Stack Demo Website by:

Conducting performance tests via JMeter.
Visualizing results with HTML reports.
Monitoring key metrics such as response time, throughput, error rates, and more.
The HTML reports include insights such as:
- Requests Summary (Pie Chart)
- APDEX (Application Performance Index)
- Response Times Over Time
- Throughput
- Error Percentage
## Test Plan Structure
- Test Script: TravelAgencyRecordController.jmx
- Results File: results.jtl
- HTML Report Folder: HTMLFORTRAVELAGENCY

 ## Performance Metrics Included
The HTML dashboard provides insights into the following metrics:

## Requests Summary:
- Displays a pie chart of successful vs. failed requests.

## Statistics:
- Key statistics like average, min, max response times, and more. Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data. It is used to understand and interpret the behavior of data, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on data.
